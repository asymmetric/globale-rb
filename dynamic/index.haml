    ### What is the *globale*? ###

    *globale* is a Berlin-based, non-profit and non-competitive film festival focusing on urgent political topics.
    The festival takes place every one and a half years. The next *globale*
    will take place from **3rd to 9th of November 2011**.

    The *globale* team is a heterogeneous group of activists working on a voluntary basis;
    we meet weekly and are searching for new members! We are always open for new collaborators and interested in helping organize *globale* programs in other cities and countries.
    Most of all we are curious about your film submissions.

    For more information and to establish contact please send an email to: <info@globale-filmfestival.org> or use the contact form on our website.
